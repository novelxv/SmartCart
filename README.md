## Introduction

Welcome to the **SmartCart** project, an innovative application designed to tackle the issue of excessive consumerism in online shopping. Our goal is to assist users in making more responsible and sustainable purchasing decisions, and to increase awareness about the impact of their consumption on the environment and society.

### Key Features

SmartCart includes a variety of features:

- **Purchase Need Analysis**: The application uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze users' buying needs based on their shopping history, preferences, and consumption trends.
- **Smart Recommendations**: During the checkout process in a marketplace, SmartCart analyzes the shopping list and provides recommendations or warnings about items that may not align with the actual needs of the users.
- **Integration with Online Shopping Platforms**: This feature allows for real-time analysis and recommendations during the checkout process without disrupting the user experience.
- **Contribution to Sustainable Shopping**: By encouraging wiser shopping decisions, SmartCart aims to reduce excessive consumerism.

## Project Components

The project consists of two main components:

### 1. SmartCart App

- **User Needs Input**: Users can input their shopping needs.
- **Shopping History**: Automatic saving of shopping history based on marketplace transaction history.
- **Need Checklist**: Automated or manual checklist to track whether the shopping needs have been met.

### 2. Dummy Marketplace App

- **App Initialization**: Users start by opening the app.
- **Mandatory Needs Input**: If the needs are not filled in the SmartCart app, users are prompted to do so.
- **Shopping and Checkout Process**: Users can shop and proceed to checkout.
- **Warnings for Unnecessary Items**: Warnings are displayed for items that may not be necessary.
- **Dismissal of Warnings**: Warnings disappear one by one after review.
- **Final Checkout**: Users can proceed to the final checkout after addressing the warnings.
